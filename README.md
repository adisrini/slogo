#SLogo

### Overview
SLogo is an integrated development environment written in Java using the JavaFX framework, along with two other team members. The software stack also includes the Microsoft Translator Text API to provide multilingual support.

The IDE supports development in the Logo programming language, a derivative of the Lisp family of languages. The language, designed in 1967, leverages graphical and body-syntotic reasoning to teach programming-related concepts to students. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mttyoaspa7U) is a video demonstrating the language in action.

### Responsibilities
During the project, my responsibilities were primarily based in software designing, front-end development, and system integration.
